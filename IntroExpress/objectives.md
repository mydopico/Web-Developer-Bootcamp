# Intro to Express

expressjs.com

* Framework - code that someone else wrote and we can use inside our application, but we use it differently than a library.
The most important difference between a library and a framework is inversion of control.
When you call a library, you are in control, but with a framwork, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.
Basically, all the control flow is already in the framework, and there's a bunch of white spots that you can fill out with your code.
A library is a collection of functionality that you can call.
Express is a web development framework
Others like Flask for Python, Rails for Ruby...

* Very popular web development framework

Two types framework: heavy and light-weight
* Heavy -  a lot of text and very little to add - for ex, Rails
* Light - More blanks and you have to fill your code more often, for ex, express. You learn more with light framework.
